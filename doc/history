! fixed "invalid number error" occuring when sizes in the DB haven't been
  declared in bytes but as e.g. "5M"
! in datafile statistics, when a datafile was filled more than 99.99%, the
  pctused column got the value '######' for this row

v0.1.2 (31.10.2003)  small enhancements:
+ in the "Data Files" block, statistics are now grouped by data files instead
  of listing up each segment separately

! temporary TS was not considered for Data Files statistics
+ added more wait events: "log buffer space", "log file * write",
  "SQL*Net message to client|dblink", "undo segment extension",
  "free buffer waits"
+ optimization: created procedure systat_per() for sysstat info
! value for "summed dirty queue length/write requests" was miscalculated when
  "write requests" was NULL
+ optimization: created procedure poolsize() for "Pool Sizes"
* moved some hardcoded font formatting to stylesheet

v0.1.5 (18.11.2003)
+ in "Selected Wait Events", Avg Waited is now more precise
  (while the system view only tells full seconds, we calculate it now
  ourselves - it's now reported in milliseconds instead of only full seconds)

+ make use of the much more detailed information on objects causing waits
  in Oracle 9 Release 2 -- for this, outsourced the block and did some ReOrg
+ added DB Cache advice (needs "db_cache_advice=ready" in the init.ora to
  show results), Shared Pool Advice and PGA Target Advice (the latter two only
  show results with Oracle 9 Release 2 and higher, since the views are not
  available in earlier versions)
+ Supressed empty tables which sometimes appeared when no data available for
  certain stats; the according link on top of the page is also removed in
  these cases

+ made the description for row migration more verbose (don't worry, it is
  in an external help file now ;)
+ added to the description for the wait events "latch free", "buffer busy
  waits", "enqueue", "free buffer waits", latch waits, "log buffer space",
  and "log file switch"

v0.2.0 (05.01.2004)
