==========================

v0.1.0 (19.01.2003)
-------------------
* initial version (first release)

v0.1.1 (28.10.2003)  small fixes:
-------------------
! fixed a "division by zero" error rarely occuring on freepct check for tables
+ added progInfo footer with link to web site of IzzySoft (e.g. for retrieving
  updates of this little tool ;)
+ added instance startup time and uptime to Common Instance Information
! fixed "invalid number error" occuring when sizes in the DB haven't been
  declared in bytes but as e.g. "5M"
! in datafile statistics, when a datafile was filled more than 99.99%, the
  pctused column got the value '######' for this row

v0.1.2 (31.10.2003)  small enhancements:
-------------------
+ in the "Data Files" block, statistics are now grouped by data files instead
  of listing up each segment separately
+ some comments/recommendations are now more precise
+ for the wait events, objects that caused them (at the time the report was
  generated) are listed
+ added more hints/comments
+ added version info to the syntax header

v0.1.3 (06.11.2003) small enhancements:
-------------------
+ Selected Wait Events block now contains more detailed stats like AvgWaitTime
+ Added "Invalid Objects" block

v0.1.4 (13.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added some more comments
+ added wait event "enqueue"
+ optimization: created procedure to retrieve the wait event stats
+ optimization: created procedure print() as wrapper to dbms_output.put_line()
! temporary TS was not considered for Data Files statistics
+ added more wait events: "log buffer space", "log file * write",
  "SQL*Net message to client|dblink", "undo segment extension",
  "free buffer waits"
+ optimization: created procedure systat_per() for sysstat info
! value for "summed dirty queue length/write requests" was miscalculated when
  "write requests" was NULL
+ optimization: created procedure poolsize() for "Pool Sizes"
* moved some hardcoded font formatting to stylesheet

v0.1.5 (18.11.2003)
-------------------
+ in "Selected Wait Events", Avg Waited is now more precise
  (while the system view only tells full seconds, we calculate it now
  ourselves - it's now reported in milliseconds instead of only full seconds)
+ many numerical values are now presented in a better readable format
+ added RPP column for Library Cache stats

v0.1.6 (27.11.2003)
-------------------
+ added DBLinks w/ check whether active or not
+ added "buffer busy waits" plus more description
+ made the disksort stats (in SYSSTAT Info) more precise
+ made description on migrated rows more precise
+ updated desc for free buffer waits
+ separated the config from the script to ease updates

v0.1.7 (03.12.2003)
-------------------
+ make use of the much more detailed information on objects causing waits
  in Oracle 9 Release 2 -- for this, outsourced the block and did some ReOrg
+ added DB Cache advice (needs "db_cache_advice=ready" in the init.ora to
  show results), Shared Pool Advice and PGA Target Advice (the latter two only
  show results with Oracle 9 Release 2 and higher, since the views are not
  available in earlier versions)
+ Supressed empty tables which sometimes appeared when no data available for
  certain stats; the according link on top of the page is also removed in
  these cases

v0.1.8 (10.12.2003)
-------------------
+ restricted the count of tables with less than 10% free blocks (reported at
  the very end of the page) to TOP_N_TABLES (new config var)
+ added enqueue stats
+ added enqueue type descs plus tuning hints
+ outsourced long hints/descs to external help files via popup on demand
+ updated installation instructions in doc/readme.txt

v0.1.9 (17.12.2003)
-------------------
+ added own help icon (used one from the Apache installation up to now)
+ made the description for row migration more verbose (don't worry, it is
  in an external help file now ;)
+ added to the description for the wait events "latch free", "buffer busy
  waits", "enqueue", "free buffer waits", latch waits, "log buffer space",
  and "log file switch"

v0.2.0 (05.01.2004)
-------------------
+ more detailed hints on the enqueue wait event
* some cosmetical changes to some of the external help files (formating issues)
+ more details on the log buffer size
+ advices for rollback segments plus external help
+ adding external help file on user information
* some cosmetical changes (text formatting)

v0.2.1 (13.01.2004)
-------------------
+ added hints on ASSM to avoid freelist contention (buffer busy waits)
* some formatting issues
+ added (external) help on row locks
* buffer pool stats table is now only drawn if data exist for it
+ added link to advices to page head (if exists)

v0.2.2 (15.01.2004)
-------------------
+ more details on row locks and I/O wait objects
+ more details on avoiding buffer busy waits
+ added PctWait and PctFailed to enqueue waits (Oracle 9+)
+ added profile and initial resource group to user info
+ added reports on resource management

v0.2.3 (20.01.2004)
-------------------
+ added extended resource plan report for Oracle 9i
* made resource plan report an optional element (see the "config" file)
+ added TableSpace Quotas (optional)
+ added DBA Profiles (optional)
+ enhanced command line syntax: now you can override some of the default
  options from the "config" file (e.g. user, passwd) at the command line
  (thanx to Manuel Soriano for this suggestion incl. code)

v0.2.4 (23.01.2004)
-------------------
* Modularization: made some blocks optional (see the "config" file):
  Rollback Segment Stats, Data Files, Memory Values, common Pool information,
  Enqueue Waits
+ new command line parameter "-c" to specify alternative config file
* some code cleanup

v0.2.5 (29.01.2004)
-------------------
+ added documentation (HTML)
* sometimes the "Wait Objects" table was created empty (Oracle removed the
  entries between the first check [for the link in the header] and creation
  of the table). Put a note in instead in these cases ;)
+ added some more details on the buffer waits, plus the optional buffer waits
  block
+ added "Chained-Fetch-Ratio" to "Sysstat Info" block
+ added block on "FreeList Contention"

v0.2.6 (04.02.2004)
-------------------
+ "Go4Colors Mode": where we can clearly identify problems (e.g. by ratios),
  the concerning values are now highlighted with red (alert) or yellow (warning)
  background color of the table cell
! report.sh was broken for Oracle versions <9
* some formatting on the help files plus more detailled information on
  cursor_sharing
+ write enabled data files that have not AUTOEXTEND ON set and filled more than
  85% / 95% are now also highlighted with Go4Colors

v0.2.7 (10.02.2004)
-------------------
+ in the TS Quotas block we now highlight rows (quotas) with non-existing
  tablespaces: these emerge when dropping a tablespace where quotas where
  explicitely given by the "ALTER USER...QUOTA..." command, and the quotas
  would automatically activated if a tablespace with that name would be created
* No more empty TSQuotas table (hopefully)
! some blocks have not been closed correctly when an error occured

v0.2.8 (16.03.2004)
-------------------
+ added closer information on "Go4Colors" to the HTML documentation
+ made the remaining values for warnings/alerts (Go4Colors) configurable
* some updates to the (HTML) documentation
* some formatting (stylesheet) updates

v0.2.9
-------------------
+ enhanced formatting of time and size values throughout the report
* outsourced the formatting functions (for common use with OSPRep)
* Modularization: Wait Events (v$system_event), SYSSTAT Info, User Info,
  DBLinks, Invalid Objects, Miscellaneous segment
