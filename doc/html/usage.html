  Called without any parameter, <code>report.sh</code> displays a short help
  page concerning its command line parameters. A normal, successful run can
  be done with just passing it the <code>ORACLE_SID</code> of the instance to
  report on as only parameter - provided your Oracle environment is set up to
  support a connect with the syntax "<code>CONNECT user/password@ORACLE_SID</code>".
  More command line parameters are available and listed in the table below:

           different configurations according to e.g. special cases (such
           as e.g. running a complete report containing all blocks just once
           a week, while having a shorter everyday report), or for groups of
           instances you want to monitor the same blocks or having the same
           user/password combinations in, and then just specify the corresponding
           config file at the command line. This file needs to be executable by

  An example command line could look like this:

    ./report.sh oradb -c maint.config -d /var/www/reports/oradb

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="eval"></a>Evaluation of results</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Since database design and usage can differ a lot between different systems,
  there is no general recipe to success on the evaluation of the reports (not
  even on the configuration of OraRep). Nevertheless, there are some values we
  may identify problems generally (e.g. by ratios). For these you can use the
  "<a href="#go4colors">Go4Colors</a> Mode", i.e. just scroll through the report
  and look for table cells having red (alert) or yellow (warning) background
  color and investigate their values first (the colors mentioned refer to the
  default stylesheet shipped with OraRep - if you modified this or use another
  one, the colors may be different or not even available if the classes are
  missing).<br>Moreover, there are several places of the report that may deserve
  closer attention even on the first evaluation and/or by the novice admin:

 <tr><td class="text">
  <table align="center" width="95%">
   <tr><th class="th_sub2">Issue</th><th class="th_sub2">Description</th></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name">Security</td>
       <td class="text">Check the "User Information" segment and look for accounts
           that may have been created anew (and maybe should not exist: most
           important on this is the "Admin" table), the assigned Profile and
           Resource Groups. Check the users TableSpace Quotas: is there a user
           having (too much) quota on a TableSpace (s)he shouldn't have?</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name">Integrity</td>
       <td class="text">Still in the "User Information" segment, check that no
           user (except for SYS and SYSTEM) has the SYSTEM TableSpace set as
           "Default" (or even "Temporary") TableSpace. For temporary TableSpaces,
           check that nowhere is a permanent TableSpace assigned. Check the
           "DB Links" table for entries having a status other than "ACTIVE".
           Check the "Invalid Objects" block for e.g. invalid indices.</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name">Performance</td>
       <td class="text">Check the "Wait Events" (focus on TimeOuts here) and
           "Wait Objects" segments. If there are too many <code>sequential
           reads</code> (which may indicate too many full table scans), this
           is one reason I would recommend using Oracle Statspack and Level 6
           snapshots together with <a href="http://www.izzysoft.de/?topic=oracle"
           target="_blank">OSPRep</a> to easily identify the "bad SQL
           statements" possibly responsible for this).</td></tr>
   <tr><td class="td_name">Resources</td>
       <td class="text">See the "Data Files" segment for file sizes, locations
           and average I/O. If e.g. all files with high I/O are located on the
           same device (disk), you may consider some reorganization to get rid
           of this I/O bottle neck - provided you have alternative devices (disks)
           available, of course. If you run Oracle 9i or higher, you may want to
           investigate the "Advices" section as well to see whether you may e.g.
           decrease some cache or pool size without performance loss (and use the
           gained memory at another place), or whether a slightly increase of
           some area may cause a significant performance gain.</td></tr>

 <tr><td class="text">
  These are just some <b><i>ideas</i></b> of where to start and what to keep in
  mind. Of course, there are many more things to consider - but either you already
  know about these, you will learn about these, or you will find somebody else
  to tell you: this documentation is not intended to be a seminary on Oracle
  Performance Tuning, there are other sources on this. If OraRep (with its
  documentation, reports and hints) got you started on this topic, or gave you
  new/more ideas about it, I did a good job :-)
 </td></tr>
 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="go4colors"></a>Go4Colors</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The "Go4Colors Mode" is intended to highlight possible problems in order to
  not overlook them. As a side effect, the DBA that supervises many instances
  has a quick way to determine whether there are possible problems that need
  his attention without reading the whole report. However, one should not rely
  on these colors alone, since they are mostly based on arbitrary values: again
  we have no perfect recipe on what "regular values" should look like - and a
  value suitable in an OLTP environment already could indicate issues for tuning
  in a batch environment, and vice versa.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Normally, a table cell with yellow background indicates a "warning", red
  background means "alert". But again, you shouldn't take these indicators
  literally: everything very much depends on your environment. So even a cell
  with red background doesn't mean you have to panic!
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  Some values that lead to a "warning" or "alert" are configurable (see
  <a href="config.html#opt">configuration</a> section of this document), others
  need no values (e.g. Quotas for non-existing tablespaces are marked with the
  "warning" color). For the default values used, please see the example
  <code>config</code> file shipped with OraRep.
