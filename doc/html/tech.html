  OraRep is written using PL/SQL and Unix Shell. While PL/SQL code is used to
  retrieve the information from the Oracle Database, Unix Shell code is used to
  construct the (anonymous) PL/SQL block (which is then executed) based on the
  users configuration. This way I realized the modular structure of OraRep, just
  including those constructs in the finally executed code that we really need
  to execute, thus limiting the overhead e.g. for unneeded parsing.

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="require"></a>Requirements</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  The requirements can directly be derived from the above paragraph and the
  intended goal: First, you need an Oracle Database Server up and running,
  otherwise there's nothing we can retrieve the information to report on. Second,
  the instance(s) of this Database Server you want to report on need to have
  PL/SQL installed, otherwise the code generated by OraRep cannot be processed
  by them. And last but not least, you need a Unix Shell (OraRep was tested
  with Korn Shell in its early stages (i.e. up to OraRep v0.1.0), and later
  versions are approved to work fine with the Bash Shell). This does imply that
  OraRep does run in *nix environments (Linux, Solaris, AIX, etc. - successfully
  tested just with RedHat Linux 7.x, other reports are welcome). There are
  Shell environments available for Windows as well, like CygWin - but since I
  didn't test OraRep in those environments I cannot guarantee that it will run
  with those; again, reports are welcome.

 <tr><th class="th_sub"><a name="lim"></a>Limitations</th></tr>
 <tr><td class="text">
  OraRep was tested successfully with Oracle versions 8.1.7, 9.0.1 and 9.2 - which
  does not necessarily mean it will not run with other versions. As always,
  reports are very welcome especially if you successfully use OraRep with Oracle
  versions &lt; 8.1.7 or &gt; 9.2, so I can correct this limitation here. For
  other limitations, please read the previous paragraph (Shell, PL/SQL, OSes).
