# Simple Database Analysis Report (c) 2003-2004 by IzzySoft (devel@izzysoft.de)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This report script creates a HTML document containing an overview on the
# database, whichs SID you either provide at the command line or configure it
# in the block below. But more than this, it not only reads the usual
# performance indicators out of the usual views, but connects values and gives
# you hints about how to use these results.
# I'ld never claim this report tool to be perfect, complete or "state of the
# art". But it's simple to use and very helpful to those not having a license
# to the expensive AddOns available at Oracle. Any hints on errors or bugs as
# well as recommendations for additions are always welcome.
#                                                              Itzchak Rehberg
