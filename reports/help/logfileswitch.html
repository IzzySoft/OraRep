 <H3>What does this event mean?</H3>
 <P>In both events, <I>log file switch (archiving needed)</I> and
    <I>log file switch (checkpoint incomplete)</I>, the LGWR is unable
    to switch into the next online redo log, and all the commit requests wait
    for this event.</P>
 <H3>What actions can be taken?</H3>
 <P>For the <I>log file switch (archiving needed)</I> event, examine why the archiver
    is unable to archive the logs in a timely fashion. It could be due to the
    following:<UL>
    <LI>Archive destination is running out of free space.</LI>
    <LI>Archiver is not able to read redo logs fast enough (contention with
        the LGWR).</LI>
    <LI>Archiver is not able to write fast enough (contention on the archive
        destination, or not enough ARCH processes).</LI></UL>
 <P>Depending on the nature of bottleneck, you might need to redistribute I/O
    or add more space to the archive destination to alleviate the problem. For
    the log file switch (checkpoint incomplete) event:<UL>
    <LI>Check if DBWR is slow, possibly due to an overloaded or slow I/O
        system. Check the DBWR write times, check the I/O system, and
        distribute I/O if necessary.</LI>
    <LI>Check if there are too few, or too small redo logs. If you have a few
        and/or small redo logs (for example two x 100k logs), and your system
        produces enough redo to cycle through all of the logs before DBWR has
        been able to complete the checkpoint, then increase the size and/or
        number of redo logs.</LI></UL></P>
