 <H3>What are <CODE>buffer busy waits</CODE>?</H3>
 <P>If two processes try (almost) simultaneously the same block and the block
  is not resident in the <CODE>buffer cache</CODE>, one process will allocate
  a buffer in the buffer cache, lock it and read the block into the buffer.
  The other process is locked until the block is read. This wait is refered to
  as <CODE>buffer busy wait</CODE>.</P>
 <P>The type of buffer that causes the wait can be queried with
  <CODE>v$waitstat</CODE>, which lists the waits per buffer type for
  <CODE>buffer busy waits</CODE> only.</P>
 <H3>What types of buffers is waited for?</H3>
